		<h1>Save Spiderman Foundation</h1>
			<p>Sony, knock it off!</p>

			<p>For decades, we the comicbook aficionados of the Marvel universe have waited for our superheroes and their magnificent stories to finally make it onto the big screen. We have been priviledged to witness the ten year story arc of the Infinity Saga which resulted in the passing of the torch from the billionaire inventor, Tony Stark, a.k.a. Ironman to the mild mannered Peter Parker a.k.a. Spiderman.</p> 

			<p>Recently, you have let your greed hinder the next great story arc of this young man taking on the mantle of his now deceased mentor and father figure. Thankfully, calmer and more intelligient minds intervened and came up with a solution and Spiderman is now back in the MCU. Hopefully, this is permanent, but we all know better.</p>
			
			<p>Here's too another great decade of storytelling and as always,... make mine Marvel!</p>
